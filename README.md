# Smart-PlantWatering-System
A smart plant watering system uses a soil moisture sensor and LCD display to monitor moisture levels in real-time. When levels drop below a set point, a pump is activated to water the plants. A water flow sensor ensures the right amount of water is delivered, promoting plant growth while conserving water.
